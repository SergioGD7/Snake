# **App Name**: Retro Snake

## Core Features:

- Snake Mechanics: Classic Snake Gameplay: Implement traditional Snake mechanics for a nostalgic gaming experience. Control the snake's movement to consume food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.
- Score Tracking: Score Tracking: Implement a scoring system that increases as the snake eats food. Display the current score prominently on the screen during gameplay.
- Game Over: Game Over Screen: Display a game over screen when the snake collides with a wall or itself. Include the final score and options to restart the game or return to the main menu.
- Level design tool: Level Selection: Implement a system that uses a tool that leverages a LLM that can adapt the play field as the user levels up and progresses through the game, or allow them to customize it according to what is needed, from more walls, less space, or additional hazards and speed. Use an LLM to create diverse experiences for the users..

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark Green (#386641) to mimic the snake's natural camouflage.
- Background color: Very light green (#f6f7d4), nearly white, for contrast and a clean look.
- Accent color: Yellow-Gold (#CDA349) for the food and other interactive elements, providing a vintage feel.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text
- Use simple, pixelated icons for food, score display, and game controls to maintain the retro aesthetic.
- The game board should take up the majority of the screen, with the score displayed at the top in a clean, minimal format.
- Simple animations for snake movement and food appearance to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
